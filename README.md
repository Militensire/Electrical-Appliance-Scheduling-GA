# Electrical Appliance Scheduling Using Genetic Algorithm
This is a project to build a model used to schedule the duration of electrical appliance usage using Genetic Algorithm (GA). the GA use 3 kind of data to do scheduling, appliance power value and priority value from each appliance, also one month of electrical bill which user want to achive.
